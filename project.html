                <p class="text">
                    SWIM-360 is pioneering the next generation of swim training through innovative AI. By combining
                    advanced video analysis with real-time biometric data from wearable sensors, we're creating an AI
                    system that provides comprehensive, personalised insights for swimmers and coaches.

                <h2 class="title">Innovation</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    The innovation behind this system lies in the seamless integration of video analysis with real-time
                    sensor data. This combination allows for a more in-depth and accurate assessment of an athlete's
                    performance by capturing both visual and physical metrics simultaneously. By merging these two
                    powerful data streams, coaches and athletes gain a more comprehensive view of movement patterns,
                    biomechanics, and technique. The use of explainable AI further enhances the system by providing
                    transparent, actionable feedback. Unlike traditional AI systems that may be perceived as a "black
                    box," this approach ensures that users can easily understand how the AI arrives at its conclusions,
                    making the feedback more valuable and interpretable. In addition to offering feedback, the system
                    provides personalized training recommendations, adapting to the specific needs and goals of each
                    individual. This level of customization ensures that athletes can target areas of improvement in a
                    way that is tailored to their unique performance characteristics.

                <p class="text">
                    The benefits of this innovation include enhanced performance optimization, as athletes can refine
                    their techniques based on precise data. It also reduces injury risk through data-driven insights
                    that identify potential areas of concern. Additionally, the technology makes advanced coaching tools
                    more accessible, providing athletes with the opportunity to benefit from cutting-edge resources.

                <p class="text">
                    This collaboration between the University of Malta and the Aquatic Sports Association of Malta
                    (ASA),
                    SWIM-360 aims to revolutionise swimming training by making advanced AI-powered analysis accessible
                    to swimmers of all levels. The project combines research excellence with practical application to
                    create a system that understands not just how a swimmer moves, but how their body responds during
                    training.
